Group 1: Social networks : online social networks, edges represent interactions between people
Group 2: Networks with ground-truth communities : ground-truth network communities in social and information networks
Group 3: Communication networks : email communication networks with edges representing communication
Group 4: Citation networks : nodes represent papers, edges represent citations
Group 5: Collaboration networks : nodes represent scientists, edges represent collaborations (co-authoring a paper)
Group 6: Web graphs : nodes represent webpages and edges are hyperlinks
Group 7: Amazon networks : nodes represent products and edges link commonly co-purchased products
Group 8: Internet networks : nodes represent computers and edges communication
Group 9: Road networks : nodes represent intersections and edges roads connecting the intersections
Group 10: Autonomous systems : graphs of the internet
Group 11:Signed networks : networks with positive and negative edges (friend/foe, trust/distrust)
Group 12: Location-based online social networks : social networks with geographic check-ins
Group 13: Wikipedia networks, articles, and metadata : talk, editing, voting, and article data from Wikipedia
Group 14: Temporal networks : networks where edges have timestamps
Group 15: Twitter and Memetracker : memetracker phrases, links and 467 million Tweets
Group 16: Face-to-face communication networks : networks of face-to-face (non-online) interactions

You need to implement all the following graph algorithms for the specified graph data set:

BFS + Topological Sorting
Dijikstra's algorithm
Belman Ford algorithm
Floyd Warshall's algorithm 

Clear documentation of algorithm, their complexity and the worst case running time for the chosen graph data set is must.
